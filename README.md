### Available datasets and analyses
| Dataset | Geant4 | HGCALTB | Comment |
| :---:   | :---:  | :---:   | :---:   |
| 1.0_1 | G4 11.2, 11.1.p01, 11.0.p02, 10.7.p03, 10.6.p03, 10.5.p01, 10.4.p03 <br> FTFP_BERT, QGSP_BERT, FTFP_BERT_ATL, FTFP_BERT_EMZ | 1.0 | Produced with geant-val, replaces all previous results on geant-val. Data for G4 10.4 and 10.5 were produced with 15k reduced statistics due to a problem in the output file for higher samples (likely a bug in g4analysis fixed in new versions). Added to geant-val on 3/4/2024. Used for presentation on 9/4/2024.|
| 0.2_1 | G4 11.2, 11.1.p01, 11.0.p02, 10.7.p03, 10.6.p03, 10.5.p01, 10.4.p03 <br> FTFP_BERT, QGSP_BERT, FTFP_BERT_ATL, FTFP_BERT_EMZ | 0.2 | Produced with geant-val, replaces all previous results on geant-val. Used for presentation on 16/2/2024. Removed from geant-val on 3/4/2024.|
| 0.1_1 | G4-11.2 <br> FTFP_BERT, QGSP_BERT, FTFP_BERT_ATL | 0.1 | Produced with geant-val for presentation on 23/1/2024. Removed from geant-val on 4/2/2024. |

    ```
3. submit a job
   ```sh
   condor_submit HGCALTB_HTCondor.sub 
   ```
4. monitor the job
   ```sh
   condor_q
   ```
   or (for persistency)
   ```sh
   condor_wait -status log/*.log
   ```
5. additional info from HTCondor (optional) \
   rm all your jobs
    ```sh
   condor_rm username
   ```
   inspect your accounting group
   ```sh
   condor_q owner $LOGNAME -long | grep '^AccountingGroup' | sort | uniq -c
   ```
   display all accounting groups
   ```sh
   haggis group list
   ```
   display your accounting groups
    ```sh
   haggis rights
   ```
   check what accounting group a job has
   ```sh
   condor_q jobid.0 -af AccountingGroup
   ```
   specify the accounting group for yout job, to be added in the .sub file
   ```sh
   +AccountingGroup = "group_u_*"
   ```
   check job CPU usage
   ```sh
   condor_q -l jobid.0 | grep CPUsUsage
   ```
   ssh to machine where job is running
   ```sh
   condor_ssh_to_job jobid.0
   ```

<!--Geant Val integration-->
## Geant Val integration
[Geant Val](https://geant-val.cern.ch/) is the Geant4 testing and validation suite. It is a project hosted on [gitlab.cern.ch](https://gitlab.cern.ch/GeantValidation) used to facilitate the maintenance and validation of Geant4 applications, referred to as <em>tests</em>.\
The following are instructions to use HGCALTB within Geant Val, from batch submission to website deployment.
1. **On lxplus**, clone HGCALTB and the Geant Val geant-config-generator
   ```sh
   https://github.com/geant-val/HGCALTB.git
   git clone https://gitlab.cern.ch/GeantValidation/geant-config-generator.git
   ```
2. [Follow the build instructions on lxplus](#build-compile-and-execute-on-lxplus)
3. Copy the HGCALTB geant val scripts into ```tests/geant4/```
   ```sh
   cp -r HGCALTB/geantval_scripts/HGCALTB/ geant-config-generator/tests/geant4/
   mkdir -p geant-config-generator/tests/geant4/HGCALTB/files
   cp HGCALTB/TBHGCal181Oct.gdml HGCALTBTB/analysis/energy.C HGCALTBTB/analysis/emprofile.C geant-config-generator/tests/geant4/HGCALTB/files/
   ```
3. We will execute HGCALTB via Geant Val using Geant4.11.2, therefore we must make sure the file ```11.2.sh``` exists in ```configs/geant/```. In the file ```11.2.sh``` we also export the path to the HGCALTB executable (compiled with 11.2). \
   Copy the config file using:
   ```sh
   ./HGCALTB/geantval_scripts/cpconf.sh \
      HGCALTB/geantval_scripts/configs/11.2.sh \
      geant-config-generator/configs/geant4/ \
      $(pwd)/HGCALTB-build
   ```
4. Create macros and metadata for Geant Val execution
   ```sh
   cd geant-config-generator
   ./mc-config-generator.py submit -t HGCALTB -d OUTPUT -v 11.2 -q "testmatch" -r
   ```
   this command creates the Geant Val files for batch submission using HTCondor under the ```OUTPUT``` folder, using HGCALTB, Geant4.11.2 and the ```testmatch``` job flavor.
5. To monitor the jobs use
   ```sh
   ./mc-config-generator.py status -t HGCALTB -d OUTPUT
   ```
   When the job execution ends, the root output files are stored in the corresponding job folder. Each job folder will look like this:
   ```
   HGCALTB-env.log  test_stderr.txt  test_stdout.txt
   HGCALTB.json  HGCALTB.mac HGCALTBout_Run0.root
   HGCALTB.sh  bsub.sh  config.sh  
   ```
6. Execute the analysis on the root files in the `OUTPUT` folder to create Geant Val JSON output files
   ```sh
   ./mc-config-generator.py parse -t HGCALTB -d OUTPUT
   ```
7. The last part is to deploy the results on Geant Val. The HGCALTB layout on the Geant Val
   website is defined in the HGCALTB.xml file on [gitlab.com/thegriglat/geant-val-layouts](https://gitlab.com/thegriglat/geant-val-layouts)
   (additional info are in the tags.json file).
   Deploy JSON files on the Geant Val database
   ```sh
    find . -name '*.json' | while read i; \
      do curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "token: askauthor" --data @$i https://geant-val.cern.ch/upload; \
      echo; done
